    "\n",
    "> All network components should inherit from `nn.Module` and override the `forward()` method. That is about it, as far as the boilerplate is concerned. Inheriting from `nn.Module` provides functionality to your component. For example, it makes it keep track of its trainable parameters, you can swap it between CPU and GPU with the `.to(device)` method, where device can be a CPU device `torch.device(\"cpu\")` or CUDA device `torch.device(\"cuda:0\")`.\n",

    "- Initialize your layers here, so that the module can keep track of these layers' parameters. \n",
    "- It is not necessary to initialize layers with no learnable parameters (e.g. `ReLU`), as you can use  the`nn.functional` API for those if you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`forward()`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define your model architecture here (i.e. call your layers in the desired order). You can use any of the Tensor operations in the `forward` function.\n",

    "Furthermore, the output layer provides a real value corresponding to each of the 10 classes for the digits 0, 1, 2, ..., 9. Hence, to use this network for classification, we can use a cross-entropy loss:: [`CrossEntropyLoss()` module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html). Hence, we can obtain the probability of each of the 10 classes after training the network.\n",
